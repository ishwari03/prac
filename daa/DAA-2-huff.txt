Huffman Encoding is a lossless compression technique used to reduce the number of bits required to represent data.
It assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent characters, minimizing total storage.

It follows a Greedy Strategy because at every step, it selects the two nodes with the smallest frequency and merges them.

Steps (Algorithm)

Take input characters and their frequencies.

Create a separate node for each character.

Insert all nodes into a min-heap (priority queue).

Repeat until only one node remains:

Extract the two smallest-frequency nodes.

Create a new parent node with frequency = sum of the two.

Set the two nodes as left (0) and right (1) children.

Insert the new node back into the min-heap.

Perform tree traversal to assign binary codes:

Left edge = 0

Right edge = 1

Display the generated Huffman Codes.

Example

Characters: A B C D E F
Frequencies: 5 9 12 13 16 45

Final Huffman Codes might be:

F: 0
C: 100
D: 101
A: 1100
B: 1101
E: 111


(May vary depending on heap tie order, but code lengths follow frequency rule.)

Code Explanation (Line-by-Line Viva Style)
Code Part	Explanation
class Node:	Defines a tree node containing character and frequency.
__lt__	Overloads < so nodes can be compared inside min-heap based on frequency.
print_codes()	Recursively traverses tree and prints codes. Left adds 0, right adds 1.
heapq.heapify(heap)	Converts list into a min-heap so smallest frequency stays at top.
heappop()	Removes and returns minimum frequency node.
merged = Node(None, left.freq + right.freq)	Creates an internal node combining frequencies of two smallest nodes.
print_codes(root)	After building tree, prints Huffman codes using DFS.
Why Greedy Strategy?

Because at every step, we choose two smallest frequency nodes (local optimal choice) and this leads to a globally optimal prefix code tree.

Advantages

Produces optimal prefix-free codes (no code is a prefix of another).

Reduces storage and transmission size.

Widely used in real-world compression algorithms.

Disadvantages

Requires frequency table prior to encoding.

Decoding requires the same Huffman Tree.

If frequencies change, re-building is required.

Real Life Applications
